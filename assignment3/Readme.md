In the 'dataset' are all raw acclerometer csv-files, also for grip2 unscrewing which isn't used in this assignment but could be essential for further experiments. 

'feat_arff' contains the feature sets for task 1 and 2 which were directly inputted into WEKA. Also the feature sets containing only one condition/class are stored there. 

The appendix contains the WEKA outputs for the best models of task 1 and 2, as it was agreed in the exercise session.
